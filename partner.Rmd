In the most recent commit, he added his hw1.html and .rmd to the repository.

I was able to knit the owner's hw1.Rmd, because he made it so his image was from a website, not a local file that I wouldn't have on my computer.

My only thing that I think would be nice is when I click new file, it would automatically put it into the directory I'm in, or have an option for that.
